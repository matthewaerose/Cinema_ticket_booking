# Cinema_ticket_booking
Display all the seats in the theater and allow users to book it by clicking it. Only one user should be allowed to reserved a specific seat. If another user clicks a seat that was booked, he should get an error. You must handle the concurrency scenarios and avoid data inconsistency.  Seats can be unbooked by clicking the booked seat again.
